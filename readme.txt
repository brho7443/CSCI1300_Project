About this Project
-----------------------
This project is developed to a game very sinilar to Dungeons of Dragons. In this game the user can buy different things 
like ingredients and cookware, weapons and armor, or even sell tresure they find int the dungeon. The user has the ability to 
fight monsters found in the dungeon as well as the ability to fight the sorcerer as a final battle before escaping. Along the way, 
they can ecounter NPCs to buy more stuff from, but have to answer a riddle correctly in order to do so. They also must watch out for 
traps when opening  doors to rooms without a key, if they fall in they must win a game of Boulder, Parchment, Shears before losing 3 times.
 
Good luck and have fun!
